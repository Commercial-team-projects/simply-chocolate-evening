          which is

        <button type="button">the benefits</button>
        <p>Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to gain an understanding of
          this type
          of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a
          taste
          comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow.</p>
